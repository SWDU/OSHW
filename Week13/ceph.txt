In previous solutions, centralized file system like NFS, 
have significant problem on scalablility. 
Ceph decouples data and metadata operations by generating functions 
rather than file allocation tables and use pseudo-random distribution function named CRUSH. 
And they use dynamic distributed metadata management bvased on Dynamic Subtree partitioning.
Ceph achieves three properties, scalability, performance and reliability.
Using CRUSH, improved data safety is achieved.
RADOS and EBOFS leverages OSDs to manage data operations and provides superior perrformance.
