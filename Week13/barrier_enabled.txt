Authors mentioned that in the era of HDD, seek and rotational delay justify the exsistence of 
I/O stack reordering and using transfer-and-flush.
However, in the era of SSD, seek and rotational delay are not existi and flash storage 
provides the cache barrier command to allow the host to control the persist order. 
Therefore, they mentioned that we should re-think the storage reordering way.
They said that overhead of guaranteeing the storage order in modern IO stack needs high cost 
storage flush.
They implement fbarrier() and fdatabarrier() that guarantees the ordering of writes 
without high cost flush to persistent storage.
