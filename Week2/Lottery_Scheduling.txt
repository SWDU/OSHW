This paper propose Lottery scheduling which allocate resources 
according to proportion of lottery tickets(or currency) tasks have.
Lottery Scheduling can be general resource management with simple implementation.
This implementation can solve starvation problem because the probability is not zero.
They prove strength of this scheduling with various experiments to prove its efficiency.
But this scheduling can be unfair because of using pseudo random.
Random number generator is important to be real random.
