Existing OS have problem of high level abstraction that occurs degrading application performance
and disturbing the functionality because all apps must share single abstractions.
Exokernel reduce the overhead by yielding the power 
to untrusted applications modifying their abstractions.
Exokernel manage these applications with secure binding, 
visible resource revocation and abort protocol.
Exokernel makes applications more intelligently using harware to their own use.
Therefore, exokernel achieves high performance and able to apply various application.
