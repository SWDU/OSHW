Although previous researches focus on avoiding remote access,
congestion on memory controllers and interconnects caused by memory traffic is the main problem for performancei because of evolution of modern NUMA hardware.
Thus, in this paper, authors propose some techniques like migration and interleaving to solve this problem.
These techniques also improve the local node access.
