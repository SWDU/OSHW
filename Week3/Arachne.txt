Authors say that tasks these days have shorter life time. 
Small requests with low latency.
Low latency cause low throughput by degrading core utilization.
This paper propose Arachne, implements core aware thread management by core-based API.
Applications know cores each one has.
Applications use cores more compactly by using multiplex requests on long-running threads.
Minimize cache misses.
Authors prove that arachne works well on various throughput and latency experiments.
