Because under-utilized facility means more the fraction cost of the facility grows, 
effective power provisioning is needed to maximize the use of power capacity in datacenters. 
This paper analyse critical power of the large scale workloads on actual datacenter. 
1. Power gap between actual-maximum and theoretical-peak is not small.(up to 40%) 
2. Dynymic power management efficiently use machines and prevent overload. 
3. CPU voltage/frequency scaling can reduce power consumption. 
Authors argue that it is important to consider not only peak performance levels but also across the activity range.

This paper's strength is the first power usage reserch of very large scale systems. 
But I think it is difficult to research this topic with insufficient equipments.
