This paper presents eprof.
eprof is the energy profiler for Android/Windows mobile smartphone apps.
Using eprof, authors reduce power consumption of four apps.
eprof use last-trigger as accounting policy because of asynchronous power behavior which occurs often in smartphone apps.
Authors shows that popular apps' major energy consumption is from I/O components and propose bundles for energy accounting.

This paper shows the problem of accounting energy consumption in application on smarthphone environments well.
And prove proposed tool, eprof, with new accounting information bundle to easily understand energy consumption is effectively works on experiments to several apps.
