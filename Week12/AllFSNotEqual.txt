Authors say that application level crash-consistency protocols have vulnerabilities on modern file systems.
Because there are active debates were occured how the underlying file systems are behave and this means that many people do not know how exactly it works.
Therefore, they mentioned that checking for the persistence properties of file system is needed and made BOB and ALICE for checking them.
BOB generates the trace of block operations of file systems and reorder them for exploring possible crash states.
ALICE analyze application level crash consistency. ALICE boils down update protocol to file system related syscalls.
They analyze application requirements atomicity across syscalls, syscall atomicity and ordering dependency by using BOB and ALICE and found several vulneralities.
Based on their analyze, they suggest ext3-fast to reduce fsync() latency by only peristing synced target file.
