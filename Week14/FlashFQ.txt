Existing schedulers aims to achieve fairness have problem achieving responsiveness. 
Because assigning timeslice approach may cause long period before replenished next timeslice. 
And fair queueing schedulers targets only for equal progress of completed work. 
Existing schedulers have problems of restricted parallelism and deceptive idleness. 
FlashFQ scheduler achieves fairness and high responsiveness for Flash-based SSDs. 
FlashFQ exploit restricted Flash I/O parallelism by throttled dispatch while maintaining fairness. 
And employs I/O anticipation to solve deceptive idleness problem.
