Traditional page-based virtual memory management was motivated by scarce physical memory.
But, because of the increased size of capable memory in these days, the question is occured.
Using the virtual memory is still a good idea?
Authors analyze the property of applications with big-memory footprints and show that 
page-based virtual memory provide little benefits and high cost.
From this question and analyze, they propose 'direct segment' for big-memory server workloads 
and proved its correctness and benefits.

The benefit of direct segment is for enabling fast and efficient address translation. 
They simply mapping the contiguous virtual address range to contiguous physical address range with HW support. 

They mention that using large page can decrease TLB misses 
but has limitation that using large page cannot scale with memory size.

Direct segment technique can avoid TLB misses but this makes unsuitable environments for concurrently running processes.
