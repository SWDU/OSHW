Authors points out some problems like latency, memory footprint, fragmentaion, etc.. 
that current huge page management has.

First, Latency problem from cleaning pages and fragmentation. 
Linux zero pages before return. So, zero large pages have more cost.
Other problem related to latency is cost of allocate large contiguous memory(2MB). 
OS should compact memory to allocate large page when memory is fragmented.

Second, increased memory footprint.
Although huge page can reduce TLB misses, 
some applications using huge pages cannot fully utilize the huge pages. 
Greedy and aggresive allocation on linux can occur unexpected effect for application's memory usage.

Third, increased fragmentation.
And unfir performance.

Ingen monitors space and time with vitvector.
Ingen supports fast page faults for low latency.
Ingen use utilization-based promotion for reduce memory footprint
and use proactive batched compaction to reduce memory fragmentation.
Ingen supports balance page sharing with performance.
