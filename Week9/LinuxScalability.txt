This paper introduce MOSBENCH and scalability issue of MOSBENCH related kernel.
Authors says that the scalability issue is not on CPU cycles, but on shared resource like DRAM bandwidth limit, cache coherence cost, network card bandwidth limit and lock etc.
Proposed designs improving scalability issue aims to reduce contention and cost of shared resource.
Analyze of MOSBENCH applications is the strength of this paper. They show the root of scalability issue and their little modifications of kernel and app can be the solution.
But the experiments of this paper might be weakness. In experiments, authors used tmpfs(im-memory file system) to avoid delayed time by I/O or buffer cache for input files to show scalable issue.
This is not exactly real workload environment. With disk I/O and Amdahl's law, the modifications of this paper might be not scalable.
