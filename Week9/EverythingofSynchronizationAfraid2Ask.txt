Observe synchronization effect for cache coherence, atomic operation, locks on different types of architectures.
    Cross-socket sharing should be avoided to avoid latency spikes compare to inter-socket latency.
    Although threads under same socket situation, LLC might incur cross-socket communication.
    Loads and stores are expensive enough compare to atomic operations on contention.
    Locking scheme should be used carefully under HW platform and expected workload.
    Message passing can reduce sharing with high performance under contention. But low performance under low contention.
Propose SSYNC, the cross-platform synchronization suit.
