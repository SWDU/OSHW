RCU shortage
    1. Complex to use
    2. Optimized for small number of writers. because RCU relies on single atomic pointer.
    3. Latency spike by waiting for readers
RLU use object-level write-log per thread and global clock for switching multiple copy. writes can defer committing until conflicts occurred.
RLU can be compatible with RCU interface.
Therefore, RLU achives its strength by increased prarlleism and lower cost of programming effort.
